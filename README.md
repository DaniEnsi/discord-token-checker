# Discord Token Checker

Extremly fast python script to check discord token for validility

# Requirements
- Input tokens into tokens.txt
- Run main.py script
- See which tokens are valid

Libraries
- colorama (pip install colorama)
- requests (pip install requests)

# Additional Info
If the request/response is very slow, I suggest to use a VPN or Proxy connection...
